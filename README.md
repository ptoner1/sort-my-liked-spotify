<h1>Sort My Liked Spotify</h1>
<p>
  Ever wanted to sort your liked songs on Spotify?
</p>
<p>
  They don't have that feature, but this user friendly application does that.  If you want to look at the final product, go to https://www.sort-spotify.com
</p>

<h1>Using the Repo</h1>
<p>
  You'll have to use your Spotify account to create a project in their development console, found here: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login.  
  You can just use your login information that you already have as a user.  When you "create an app", it'll give you your Spotify SECRET and KEY environment variables.
</p>
<h1>Tweaking the Repo</h1>
<p>
  Spotify makes it clear that any apps that use its API need to be styled very similarly to it's actual base application: www.open-spotify.com so if you want to 
  change the styling, don't go too far.  Read more here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/design-and-branding/

<h3>
  Improvement Suggestions
</h3>
<p>
  I thought it'd be unnecessary to allow the user to generate playlists of over 100 songs (which is the API limit), but you could definitely do another work-around 
  like the "Add Songs" button on the homepage.
